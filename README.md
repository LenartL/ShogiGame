# Personal Shogi Project

### Purpose

This project isn't meant to be a commercial product, 
it's purpose is to be a personal learning journey to experiment with different concepts, such as:
- Websocket
- REST
- Spring Security configurations
- TDD, Unit and Integration tests
- Design patterns
- Java Reflection
- Angular standalone components
- SCSS
- and also having fun implementing a game

It's far from complete in it's current state
